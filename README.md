### Hello!

I am a biomedical scientist with a master's degree in molecular and cell biology. I am currently a PhD student in Neuroscience at the [Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro](http://www.unirio.br/). I have 7 years of experience in research and scientific writing in the field of bioinformatics and computational biology :microscope: :desktop_computer:.

I have experience with Python :snake:, R, and SQL programming languages, in addition to machine learning and data analysis libraries, including sklearn, tensorflow, keras, pandas, numpy, and ggplot2.
